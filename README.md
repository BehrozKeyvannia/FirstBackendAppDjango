# FirstBackendAppDjango
My first app in Django framework with Python

A Django serverapp containing an admin page at the moment. With the admin page is the underlying database contents as well. 
The serverapp is protected with a login page with corresponding username and password. 

To run the serverapp, download the zip file and runt "python manage.py runserver". Visit then localhost:8000 and localhost:8000/admin
